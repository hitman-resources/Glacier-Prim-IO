A short overview of upcoming near-term changes, features, and fixes:

- [x] Auto generation of low res texture maps for imported textures.
- [ ] Support for texture resizing
- [ ] Support for patch file merging
- [ ] Basic support for material editing 
- [ ] Mesh discovery tool
- [ ] Option to exclude LOD models during export.
- [ ] Examples/Tutorials
- [ ] I/O of materials directly through glTF files for simple materials.
